/**
 * TL auto-schedule projection unit (`tlAutoSchedule`).
 *
 * Issue #6 background — the two defects this unit exists to fix:
 * - The scheduler sampled tool calls from `agent.session.events`, an array
 *   property that only existed on 0.1.0-rc.8. From 0.1.2-rc.1 onward the host
 *   exposes `eventAt()/snapshotEvents()/ownEvents()` instead, so the sampler
 *   returned `[]` on 13 of the 14 supported host lines and `auto` silently
 *   collapsed to `low`. Those three readers are now `@deprecated` with an
 *   explicit "new production calls are prohibited" policy
 *   (`packages/core/session/README.md:62`), so re-binding to them is not an
 *   option either.
 * - The host seeds every request's `reasoningEffort` from the previous
 *   `request/header`, i.e. from THIS plugin's own output
 *   (`core/agent-loop/src/agent.ts:573-581`), so treating a concrete seed as a
 *   manual pick froze `auto` after the first request of a session.
 *
 * Both are solved by reading/writing a Session projection instead of the log:
 * - `apply` folds `tool/call` events into a bounded ring → `samples`.
 * - `apply` folds `model/selection` events into `userEffort`. That event has
 *   exactly one production writer, the user-facing selection command
 *   (`api/session-controller/src/agent.ts:340` ← `commands.ts:176`), so the
 *   plugin's own injection can never pollute it — the echo disappears by
 *   construction and needs no "remember what I injected" side table.
 *
 * Projections are the sanctioned read path ("reads the projection"), are
 * folded lazily over the in-memory log on first read (so resumed/forked
 * sessions are complete), and cost O(1) per request afterwards.
 *
 * Explicitly NOT used: the host's `modelSelection` projection. Its `lastUsed`
 * is rewritten on every `request/header` (i.e. it holds this plugin's own
 * output) and `pending` is cleared once a matching header commits
 * (`api/session-controller/src/model-selection-projection.ts:39-58`), so
 * neither field carries a durable user intent.
